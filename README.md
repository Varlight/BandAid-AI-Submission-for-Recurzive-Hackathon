# Bandaid AI

Bandaid AI is an artificial intelligence assistant designed to revolutionize patient care in hospitals. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, Bandaid AI streamlines workflows, reduces nurse burnout, minimizes medical errors, and enhances patient outcomes.

## **Hackathon Submission**

This project was made and submitted for the Recurzive Hackathon ([recurzive.xyz](https://recurzive.xyz)).

Check out our project on Devfolio: [Bandaid AI](https://devfolio.co/projects/bandaid-ai-f4d6).

## **Project Status**

**This project is a work in progress and yet to be completed.**

## Motivation

Nurses often manage more patients than recommended, which can lead to increased medical errors and burnout. According to a study by Penn LDI, each additional patient per nurse raises patient mortality likelihood by 7%. Bandaid AI aims to address this issue by optimizing the workflow, allowing nurses and doctors to focus more on direct patient care.

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Check-Ins
- **Natural-Sounding AI:** Contacts patients via bedside intercoms, posing standardized questions.
- **Emotion and Health Cues Analysis:** Records and analyzes interactions to prioritize care based on mood and condition.

### 2. Behavior and Sentiment Analysis
- **Video and Audio Monitoring:** Utilizes advanced AI to analyze patient behavior and sentiment from video and audio feeds.
- **Comprehensive Assessment:** Provides a thorough understanding of patient well-being beyond verbal communication.

### 3. Automatic Telemetry Updates
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Continuously updates the dashboard with telemetry data from connected devices.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Facilitates early detection of potential health issues through continuous monitoring.

### 4. Multidimensional Monitoring and Correlation
- **Integrated Data Analysis:** Correlates video, audio, telemetry data, patient inputs, and past health records.
- **Holistic View:** Offers a comprehensive, multidimensional view of patient health to healthcare providers.

### 5. Priority Order of Care
- **Smart Ranking System:** Uses sentiment analysis and health data to prioritize patient care.
- **Urgent Alerts:** Immediately notifies nurses and doctors of any critical information.

### 6. Real-Time Updates and Simple UI
- **User Interface:** Nurses and doctors can check the order of their visits and patient statuses anytime through a simple UI.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Keeps medical staff informed with the latest patient information.

### 7. Downloadable Reports
- **PDF Record Retrieval:** Generates downloadable reports from the dashboard, ensuring all patient interactions and conditions are well-documented.

## Technical Stack

- **Databricks:** For sentiment analysis and ranking.
- **Hume AI:** For analyzing emotional cues.
- **Resend:** For the alert system.
- **Nextjs:** For rapid development and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up
1. **Clone the repository:**
    
2. **Set up the environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and other environment variables:
    ```env
    DATABRICKS_API_KEY=your_databricks_api_key
    HUME_AI_API_KEY=your_hume_ai_api_key
    RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
    ```

## Impact and Benefits

- **Reduces Nurse Burnout:** By automating routine tasks and prioritizing patient needs, Bandaid AI reduces the burden on nurses, allowing them to focus on more critical care tasks.
- **Improves Patient Outcomes:** Ensures that the most critical patients receive immediate attention, helping improve overall patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.
- **Enhances Diagnostic Accuracy:** Provides a richer diagnostic context through multimodal data analysis, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis.
- **Promotes Efficient Healthcare Delivery:** Streamlines workflows and optimizes resource allocation, enhancing overall healthcare efficiency.

## Future Plans

- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Incorporate advanced diagnostic tools and integrate with wearable health devices for continuous monitoring.
- **Scalability:** Expand deployment across multiple hospitals to gather diverse feedback and further improve the system.

## Conclusion

Bandaid AI is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care in hospitals. By leveraging AI and real-time data analysis, we aim to improve patient care and reduce the stress on healthcare providers.
